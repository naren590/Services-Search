This theme of the project is to search persons using their attributes like id, location, skill etc.., In this project the database was a NonSQL database. 
The database has 4 fields(Id, Name, Location and Skills array).
In this project Get methods are used to obtain data. 
The types in get methods are Gettimg all the data, searching a person using their Id, Location and a single skill.
There are two more get methods in this project which are getting all persons who have two same skills and getting all persons who have either one of the skills.
For the front end part I have used swagger ui.
